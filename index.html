    <h1>Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Status Downloader</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 02, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <p>WhatsApp Status Downloader ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App"), which allows users to download WhatsApp video statuses stored on their Android device. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Storage Data</strong>: The App requires access to your device’s storage to locate and download WhatsApp video statuses. We only access the WhatsApp status folder (e.g., WhatsApp/Media/.Statuses) and do not collect or store any other files or personal data from your device.</li>
            <li><strong>App Usage Data</strong>: We may collect non-personal information about how you interact with the App, such as the number of statuses downloaded or App crashes, to improve performance and user experience. This data is anonymized and does not identify you personally.</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: The App does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifiable data unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., through contact forms or support requests).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable the core functionality of the App, which is to locate and download WhatsApp video statuses stored on your device.</li>
            <li>Improve the App’s performance, fix bugs, and enhance user experience through anonymized usage data.</li>
            <li>Respond to user inquiries or support requests if you contact us directly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your information to third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may use third-party services (e.g., analytics providers) that process anonymized data on our behalf to improve the App. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>The App processes WhatsApp video statuses locally on your device and does not upload or store them on our servers. We implement reasonable security measures to protect any anonymized usage data we collect, but no system is completely secure. You use the App at your own risk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may include third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect anonymized usage data. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. The App does not interact with WhatsApp directly or access WhatsApp’s servers; it only reads locally stored status files with your permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>You can control the App’s access to your device’s storage by managing permissions in your Android settings. If you have concerns about your data, you may contact us to request information about the data we have collected or to request its deletion (if applicable).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
    </div>
